      Hi, I’m Peter, a Canadian currently calling Korea home. What began as a childhood fascination with mechanical engineering, sparked (admittedly) by Iron Man, soon blossomed into a deeper love for the world of AI. At my core, I’m driven by two simple truths: helping people and having fun along the way. These values naturally led me to engineering roles in the medical sector. Having spent a few years in this industry, I’m now ready to explore other fast-evolving sectors.

When I step away from work, you’ll often find me lost in the rhythm of writing poetry, coaxing melodies from the piano, or chasing fleeting moments of beauty through my camera lens. These passions keep my creativity flowing and fill my every day with a sense of wonder. Music, too, is a constant companion—jazz and 1980s Japanese city pop resonate most deeply with me, and I return time and again to the timeless tones of Stan Getz and Tatsuro Yamashita. 
      <br><br>
      Some images on this website are based on my own photographs, and I have posted some of the poems I’ve written. Enjoy!
