<div class="poem-wrapper">
<div class="poem-card">
Stepping through the dull grey walls,
Without a thought in mind,
I march.

My footsteps scattered
On the tainted snow.
From up high,
As trails of ants.

Sludging through the darkened snow,
With habitual rhythm,
I march.

Time removes my tracks.
Marching on, I go.
Where are you,
Ariadne?

Without an exit in sight,
Yet, for another day,
I march.
