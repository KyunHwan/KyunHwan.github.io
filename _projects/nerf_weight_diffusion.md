    <h1>Neural Rendering</h1>
    
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>This project explores the intersection of computer graphics and deep learning, focusing on neural rendering techniques that can generate photorealistic images from 3D scenes.</p>

    <h2>Key Features</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) implementation</li>
      <li>Real-time view synthesis</li>
      <li>3D scene reconstruction</li>
      <li>Photorealistic rendering</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Technical Details</h2>
    <p>The project utilizes PyTorch for deep learning components and implements various neural rendering architectures. It includes both training and inference pipelines for generating novel views of 3D scenes.</p>

    <h2>Results</h2>
    <p>The implementation achieves high-quality novel view synthesis with realistic lighting and material properties. The system can handle complex scenes with multiple objects and varying lighting conditions.</p>
