The pattern of sounds that all fear to utter yet yearn to hear
Inside me, its source flutters, all the more strongly when you're near.
I hold tenderly onto its wings, so as not to tear,
Afraid that the flapping of its wings, moving the air
Would turn your gaze towards what I hold dear.

I have endured the pain of caging what wills to be free,
For you may find what I find to be religiously beautiful irreverently revolting.
As this imprisonment slowly suffocates the caged,
With it, part of me will eventually fade.
So please forgive my selfishness in freeing it.

As it cautiously breaks away from my grasp and takes flight into the world,
I helplessly watch it glide towards its destination,
Leaving a turbulent trail of passionate red, longing blue, and pure white.
Do with it as you wish, for I cannot bear to see its end.
I surrender myself wholly to you.
